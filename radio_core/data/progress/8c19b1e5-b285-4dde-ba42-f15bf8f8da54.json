Use metaphors, mood setting, or short storytelling.\n\n            Song Transcripts:\n            Song: Billie Eilish - bad guy\nTranscript:\n My invisible line has been I have taken out my invisible line and this is the album My blood is still sleeping, you're on your tip, be toes creeping Up around the black, no one knows, think you're so...\n\nSong: Billie Eilish - Ocean Eyes\nTranscript:\n I've been watching you for some time Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes Burning my cities and nape arms guys Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes Your ocean eyes all fall You're the night that ...\n\n\n            Here are some example scripts to inspire your style (replace {artist} and {song_name} with actual values):\n            Script: Tonight, I need your company.

What are you up to this weekend? Text me on 03700 100 100—I’ll give you a shoutout! Until then, it’s an hour of back-to-back anthems from Rudimental, DJ Fresh, and Red Light. Let’s get into it!\nScript: Big salute to the MOBOs! Best Video? Skepta – 'That’s Not Me.' From streets to the spotlight, this one's for the real ones. Only cost £80, and still changed the game.

Sometimes the world feels a little too bright, a little too loud, doesn’t it? Let’s just… drift for a moment. Let the sound wash over you. This next one feels like a midnight swim, a secret whispered in the dark. It's Billie Eilish – and this is “bad guy.”"
