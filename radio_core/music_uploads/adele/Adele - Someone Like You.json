  "transcript": " I That's all settle down that you found a girl and you're married That's your dreams came true Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend Why are you so shy and like you to hold back Oh I hate to turn up out of the blue one invited but I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face and that you be reminded that for me It is Never mind I'll find someone like you Oh I wish nothing but the best are you Don't forget me I think I remember you say sometimes it hurts instead It's But sometimes it hurts and stay You know how the time flies only yesterday was the time of our lives And we were born and raised in a summer haze bound by These surprise All our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue one invited But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for me it is nowhere Never mind I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best are you Don't forget me I think I remember you say sometimes it hurts and stay Nothing compares no worries okay regrets and mistakes their memories made Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste Never mind I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best for you Don't forget me I think I remember you say sometimes it hurts and stay Never mind I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best are you Don't forget me I think I remember you say sometimes it hurts and stay Sometimes it hurts and stay"
