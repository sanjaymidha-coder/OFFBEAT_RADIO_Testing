  "transcript": " I just got here and I think I'm losing signal already. Hello? Can you hear me now? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hello? Hello, it's me. I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything. They say the time's supposed to heal you, but I ain't done much healing. Hello, can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger and free. I've forgotten how it felt before the world felt like I'd feed there's such a difference between us and a million miles. Hello from the other side, I must have caught a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done but when I call you, never seem to be home. Hello from the outside, at least I can say that I've tried to turn you home. Sorry for breaking your heart but it don't matter, it's clearly, it doesn't tell you apart anymore. Hello, how are you? It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry. I hope that you will. Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened? It's no secret that the bold of us are running out of time. Hello from the other side, I must have caught a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done but when I call you, never seem to be home. Hello from the outside, at least I can say that I've tried to turn you home. Sorry for breaking your heart but it don't matter, it's clearly, it doesn't tell you apart anymore. Hello from the other side, I must have caught a thousand times to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done but when I call you, never seem to be home.
