  "transcript": " When your legs don't work like they used to before And I can't sweep you off of your feet Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks Darling, I will be loving you till we're 17 And baby my heart could still full us Hard at 23 And I'm thinking about how people fall in love in a steery way Maybe just the touch of a hand Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day And I just wanna tell you I am so honey now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me after the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my feet and heart Thinking out loud maybe we found love right where we are When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades And the crowds don't remember my name When my hands don't play the strings the same way I know you will still love me the same Cause honey you're so could never grow Oh, let's ever green And baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory I'm thinking about how people fall in love in a steery way And maybe it's all part of a plan Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes Hoping that you'll understand the baby now Take me into your loving arms Kiss me after the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my feet and heart Thinking out loud maybe we found love right where we are So maybe now take me into your loving arms Kiss me after the light of a thousand stars Place your head on my feet and heart Thinking out loud maybe we found love right where we are And baby we found love right where we are"
