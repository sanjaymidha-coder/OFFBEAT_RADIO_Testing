  "transcript": " I've been watching you for some time Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes Burning my cities and nape arms guys Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes Your ocean eyes all fall You're the night that make me cry When you give me those ocean eyes Once again Never fall even white inside fall into the air All shine lies, those ocean eyes I've been walking through world of light Can't stop thinking of your diamond light Careful, great you're made friends with time You left her lonely with the diamond light And those ocean eyes all fall You're the night that make me cry When you give me those ocean eyes Once again Never fall even white inside fall into the air All shine lies, those ocean eyes That's the diamond light That's the diamond light And those ocean eyes all fall You're the night that makes me cry All fair You really know how to make me cry When you give me those ocean eyes Once again Never fall even white inside fall into the air All shine lies, those ocean eyes That's the diamond light And those ocean eyes all fall You're the night that makes me cry When you give me those ocean eyes Once again Never fall even white inside fall into the air"
