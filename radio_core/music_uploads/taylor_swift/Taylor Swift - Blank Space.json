  "transcript": " I can read you like a magazine In a funny, rumors fly And I know you heard about me So hey, let's be friends I'm dying to see how this one ends Grab your passport in my hand I can make the bad guys good for a weekend So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down and play And you can tell me when it's over Hmm, it's the high ones worth the pain Got a lonely Starbucks lover They'll tell you I'm insane Cause you know I love the players And you love the gay Cause we young and we're eggless We'll take this way too far It'll leave you pregnant Hmm, or with a nasty scar Got a lonely Starbucks lover They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space baby And I'll write your name Terry, lips, crystal skies I could show you incredible things So the kiss is pretty lies Through the king baby I'm your queen find out What you want Be that girl For a month Wait the worst Is yet to come Oh no Screaming, crying Perfect storms I can make all the tables turn Rose, garden, filled with thorns Keep your second guessin' like Oh my god, who is she? I get drunk on jealousy But you'll come back each time you leave Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down and play And you can tell me when it's over Hmm, it's the high ones worth the pain Got a lonely Starbucks lover They'll tell you I'm insane Cause you know I love the players And you love again Cause we yonkin' we're reckless You'll take this way too far We'll leave you breathless Or with the nasty scar Got a lonely Starbucks lover They'll tell you I'm insane But I've got a blank space baby And I'll write your name Boys only one love if it's torture Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya Boys only one love if it's torture Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya So it's gonna be forever Or it's gonna go down and play And you can tell me when it's over Or it's gonna go down and play And you can tell me when it's over Wait a second Why're you buying so much space? It's a forbidden bill It's gonna be forever Get that muzzle out Whatever you think Why're you buying so much space baby And I'll write your name you"
