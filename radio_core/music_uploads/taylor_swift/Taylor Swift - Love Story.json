  "transcript": " We were both young when I first saw you. I closed my eyes and the flashback starts. I'm standing there. On the balcony and summer air. See the lights, see the party, the foggams. See you make you wait through the crowd and say hello. Little did I know. Let it you know we owe you a throw in pebbles. And my daddy said, stay away from Juliet. And I was crying on the staircase begging you please don't go. And I fear, ready to take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting all this has to do is run. You will be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby just say yes. So I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet because we're dead if you so close your eyes. I'll skip this town for a little while. Oh, because you were on me oh I was a scarlet. Better and my daddy said, stay away from Juliet. But you were everything to me. I was begging you please don't go. And I said, throw me a take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting all this has to do is run. You will be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story baby just say yes. Throw me a say. Baby, try to tell me how to feel. It's all this difficult but it's a re-ins. Don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story baby just say yes. I got to wait in you. Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in yours, baby. When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said, when you're saved me, I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you but you never come as this. And my head I don't know what to think. He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said, marry me Juliet, you're never hard to be alone. I love you and that's all I really know. I'm talking to your darn good pick out of wire. Just a love story baby just say yes. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh"
